Summary
I am a passionate engineer about data.  Data is what drives the world and helps us make better
 decisions.  I love learning what to track and how to track it!  

I use technology everyday.  Finding the right technology for the job at hand is one of my favorite
 things to do.

One last thing, hook 'em!
