3 people have recommended Anirudh

"I’ve been Anirudh Subramanian’s co-mentor for the GSoC 2012 project. Working with him has
been an honor and a pleasure. He is always prompt, precise and constructive, proposing very
good solutions to problems. He has always followed mentors’ suggestions, but he also enriched
such suggestions with his ideas. He has worked in a very independent way, in according with his
mentors. He has collaborated with another GSoC student too, to merge their projects (since they
were related to the same open source project), showing good skills also in cooperative working
with other people. Moreover, the code he developed was very well designed and written. During
the whole project, he has shown different and high skills (in learning new issues and technologies,
coding, designing interfaces, testing phases, communicating, etc). He is very qualified and I’ll be
glad to work with him again."
—Silvia Mirri, Assistant professor,  Università di Bologna,  managed Anirudh at Google

"Anirudh is a hard working software developer that worked with us last summer as an intern at
Freescale Semiconductor. We understand embedded developers but did not have experience with
SaaS and Cloud solutions. Anirudh helped us develop a prototype of cloud services that included
establishing cloud servers, leveraging a scalable Linux server framework and built a PC based
plugin to our tools to connect to the cloud for getting software updates. The server side required
analytics work, database integration, and included a REST API implementation. Anirudh also taught
himself some embedded programming and worked in collaboration with both a local and remote
team in Europe. Hard working, curious, professional, very capable for IT or cloud based systems
work."
—Greg Hemstreet, Sr. Software Development Manager,  Amazon,  managed Anirudh at Freescale
Semiconductor

"I’ve worked with Anirudh Subramanian for the Google Summer of Code 2012, mentoring his
project. He did an excellent job, working for the whole period in a very productive and constructive
way. During the project, he was very committed and shown to be high skilled both in designing and
coding the software application. More specifically he shown to be able to manage large applications
written in PHP, understanding the code architecture and suggesting strategies to improve its

features. He was involved in correcting bugs, designing and implementing new functionalities and
improving the software interface having care of its accessibility. He was accurate in scheduling the
tasks and rigorous in respecting all the deadlines. He was also excellent in communication skills,
being very cooperative in working with other people and very proficient in contributing to team work.
I think Anirudh is an outstanding student, very well-qualified and greatly motivated."
