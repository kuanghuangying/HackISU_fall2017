Automate Testbed reinstalls
In order to ensure a clean test environment and good quality of test results, testbeds must be
 periodically reinstalled. This was being done manually and this was a time-consuming task and
 prone to human errors, affecting both quality and availability of the testbeds.

My project is to write python scipts to reinstall all components in testbed automatically.
There are 4 different components of the testbed:
1) Switches
2) Network control machines (NCS)
3) Servers connected to the switches (End-hosts)
4) A proxy machine located close to the testbed.
