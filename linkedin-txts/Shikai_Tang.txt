Large Scale Ads Click-Through Rate (CTR) & Install Rate (IR) Estimation Through Spark.
-- I contributed 50% of production model codes. The built models are applied to 40B daily bidding
 events.
-- I contributed 50% of the internal model training & performance monitoring platform codes.

Double-Major Master Student in Computer Science at UC Davis
December 2012  -  March 2015  (2 years 4 months)

－ I took a project oriented master which focused on Deep Learning for Image Classification. 
－The purpose of this project is to design some visualization toolkits that help researchers
 more efficiently build some deep neural network for any specific Image Classification task. The
 built framework is easily adapted for other related machine vision project, for instance, object
 detections. I use Caffe and  Cuda-convnet as the backend deep learning training tools, then I
 extract some intermediate deep layer learning outputs, visualize them through Graphviz and build
 some frontend web pages through Flask.

Data Warehouse Intern at Shutterfly Inc.
June 2014  -  August 2014  (3 months)

– I am the major architect involving Shutterfly Big Data Analytics POC Project
– I am responsible setting up and testing most current open source big data platforms (Hadoop,
 Spark, Cassandra, Hive, HBase, Storm) in a six-node development Linux cluster. Giving five
 months’ user image uploading metadata (7.1 TB and 1.7 billion pics), I design the ETL framework
 to build up the users’ image style profile.
– Every week, I report my progress on development cluster and propose better alternatives
 (Hadoop vs Spark, Cascading and Storm, Cassandra vs HBase, MySQL and Oracle) for
 improvement. I wrote MR job using Hadoop (Java), Spark(Scala), or Storm (Java). I evaluated
 the performances when coupling Hadoop with MySQL, Cassandra, and Spark with Cassandra.
 Although it’s a team discussion product, I drafted the big data analytics ETL pipeline.
