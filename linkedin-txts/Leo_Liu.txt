Siri Speech Engineer at Apple

Summary
I am a recent MIT graduate with a Master’s in Computer Science.

I am a full-stack engineer with a ton of systems background. Including my coursework and
 internships, I have experience in low-level code (OS, databases, distributed systems, improving
 performance), big data/analytics (Hadoop), and front-end (webapps, UI). My master's research
 focused on deep neural networks for speech recognition. I am very good at debugging and solving
 problems.

Experience
Software Engineer at Apple
July 2015  -  Present  (2 years 4 months)

Siri Speech Engineer.

Graduate Researcher at MIT Spoken Language Systems
September 2012  -  May 2015  (2 years 9 months)

* Wrote scripts for building speech recognizers. Built recognizers for Turkish, Pashto, and
 Cantonese.
* Investigated the use of low-precision math in deep neural networks for acoustic models. Low-
precision math is one approach for speeding up DNN training. (Thesis linked below in Publications)
* Trained DNNs for Dialect and Language Identification using acoustic features.
* Worked with Kaldi, Theano, CNTK, and LSTM-RNNs.

Software Engineering Intern at Cisco
June 2014  -  August 2014  (3 months)

* Developed a script/webapp to help engineers spend less time generating stack traces.
* Wrote a script that reproduces a bug on the router by sending commands over Telnet.
* Benchmarked in-memory databases on IOS XR operating system.
* Optimized the download speed of labeled routes on the ASR9K router. Identified the IPC
 messaging system as a bottleneck and developed a faster replacement.

Software Engineering Intern at Yahoo!
May 2013  -  August 2013  (4 months)

* Worked on a rate limiter for cloud services (blog post about it linked below). Integrated the rate
 limiter into a web server.
* Created a new data model for specifying limits, wrote a C++-to-Perl wrapper, and fixed bugs.
* Wrote a distributed resource monitor, which could be used to distribute the rate limiting. For
 scalability, it uses a gossip protocol that arranges nodes in a tree.

Software Engineering Intern at Flickr
December 2012  -  February 2013  (3 months)

* Wrote a program to upload log files to Hadoop File System. It automatically recovers from
 crashes.
* Extended analytics program to track users by 4 new business dimensions.

Software Engineering Intern at Flickr
June 2012  -  August 2012  (3 months)

* Wrote an algorithm to count Flickr users per hour/day/week/month over rolling periods of time.
* It also tracks users by 2 business dimensions (user subscription state and request type).
* Implemented an end-to-end analytics process and a dashboard. Used Pig/Java/PHP/MySQL/
jQuery.
* Deployed to a production Hadoop cluster - processes 12 GB/hour in 20 minutes.

Intern at Stanford University
June 2010  -  August 2011  (1 year 3 months)

* Wrote "XML Log Toolkit", a tool for visualizing, modifying, and filtering log files.
* Added functions to a PIC programmable board and installed a sensor network of 200 devices.

President and Software Lead at CHS Robotics Club
2007  -  2011  (4 years)

* Member all 4 years since its founding. Taught programming, fundraised, and recruited.
* Wrote software for image processing, accelerometer, wheel control, IR receiver, and robot arm.
