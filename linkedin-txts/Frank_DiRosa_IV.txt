Summary
I am a Senior Computer/Software Engineer at Texas A&M and I enjoy studying computer
 architecture, cyber security, and algorithm design. I have worked extensively on many personal
 and professional projects dealing with managing performance and writing scalable code. Most
 recently I've worked in IT as a UI/UX Designer and Full-Stack Web Devloper. When I'm not coding or
 watching Netflix, I love to spend my free time outdoors or playing the violin. Something about playing
 music always helps me approach technical problems with a fresh and creative approach.
