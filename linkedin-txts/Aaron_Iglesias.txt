1 person has recommended Aaron

"Aaron did a tremendous job as the "Executive Director of SHPE Region 7 March Madness." The
program had a significant impact on the region. The results were noticed by myself and my peers
on the SHPE National Board of Directors. The following year, the program that Aaron developed
was made into a national program and has had a significant impact on the organization over the
last 2 years!"
