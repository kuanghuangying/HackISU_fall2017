1 person has recommended Ankit

"I mentored Ankit during his internship experience at Google. Ankit is enthusiastic, persistent and
has excellent programming skills. He understands the nuances of working with a large codebase
and writing modular extensible code. He has exposure to good design practices, writes unit tests for
his code and is comfortable building something which can be extended upon later. At the start of his
internship, Ankit was provided with an open-ended problem. He started off independently, doing his
research by reading up on research papers, talking with senior people in the company to come up
with initial algorithms which he later refined over the period of 2 months. He was able to completely
demonstrate the solution, checkin all his code and unit tests and also provide documentation on his
work during this short period. I wish him best of luck for all his future endeavors."
