"I was visiting professor at NUS Singapore April through July 2011 and worked at the NUS HCI
Lab, headed by Prof. Shengdong Zhao. During my time at the NUS HCI Lab, i had the pleasure to
advise and work with Yi Bo, who was then a graduate student. I have come to learn Yi Bo as an
outstanding engineer and computer scientist. He takes on a task, carries out the work, and comes
back with the results expected -- often more -- at time. He delivers first-class results and will be a
great contribution to any R&D in the area of computer science, computer consulting, development,
and/or innovation. Morten Fjeld, PhD Associate Professor Head of t2i Lab, www.t2i.se Chalmers
