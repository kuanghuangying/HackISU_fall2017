I am working on building a new Chrome extension named Wernicke that enables users to interact
 with the DOM structure of a web page and annotate the page structures lively. To ensure the
 annotation quality, Wernicke proposes a behavior-based method, in which the annotation quality
 is predicted through users’ implicit behavioral features such as time spent on annotation, number
 of mouse clicks, scrolls and etc. Results found that behavioral signals indeed predict annotation
 quality more robust and reliable.
