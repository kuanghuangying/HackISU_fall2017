Summary
Software Developer and Engineer, currently working as SDET in Big Data environment. I have
 broad range of experience from numerically modelling electromagnetic systems to cloud computing,
 analyzing transaction data from US stock markets. 
I am a big fan lean approach in general and agile methodology in particular, test-drive development,
 behavior driven development and continuous delivery. 
Experienced with Java, Scala, C/C++, cloud technologies, Spark, Hadoop, Data bases and Amazon
 Web Services

Experience
Software Engineer at Apple
September 2017  -  Present  (2 months)

Software Development Engineer in Test at Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)
January 2015  -  Present  (2 years 10 months)

Working on Big Data, Cloud platforms that are responsible for collecting,  processing and analyzing
 the data from received from majority of US stock market participants. These platforms utilize wide
 range of technologies to ensure that the application is capable of routinely processing, storing and
 accessing terabytes of data on daily basis.
As a member of agile team participate in the Agile software development an using the required
 tools. Including daily Scrum, Spring Planning, Code Reviews, Test Case reviews. Using JIRA,
 Jenkins and other tools that facilitate agile development.

As member of Agile Team my main responsibility is to ensure the quality of the system by
 designing, maintaining and extending automated test frameworks. These frameworks are capable
 of exercising testing of the system components in local mode (for instance, using Local Spark
 mode, mocking HBase, etc), in cluster mode (using persistent and/or EMR clusters) and using
 automated Jenkins builds.

The test frameworks covers various components of the system ranging from ETL Hadoop/Spark
 jobs to Relational and NoSQL databases and communication to remote servers, setting up virtual
 machines and so on.

Performed analysis of the data to create model that would effectively represent of the behavior of
 real data

Primary responsibilities include design, creation and expansion of automated frameworks that
 ensures the quality of various component of the system, including functional test, stress /load tests
 and testing on the cluster.  Use Java, Scala and various tools, like Cucumber, JUnit to test various
 components of the system
Mission critical system
Use wide range of technologies, 
Programming Languages: Java, Scala, C++
Software development tools: Cucumber
Data Bases: Oracle SQL, Hive, Pig, MySQL, Hbase
Cloud Technologies: AWS 
Apache Spark, Apache Hadoop, Cloudera CDH
Linux/Windows
