2 people have recommended Lakshman

"Lakshman and I worked together for about 3 years; in those years I have seen him that he is a
very calm and composed person with strong technical knowledge. He used to stretch beyond his
limit and proactively takes different tasks which are both critical and difficult for the team’s growth.
Organization valued his contributions and commitments by honoring him with Best Employee
awards and spot awards. When he left the company for his higher studies, he literally created a
vacuum in our team which we took couple of months to fill. I really enjoyed working with him, and I
feel person like him is a real asset to any organization. I wish all the best for his studies and future
career. "
—Junaid Moh'd, Architect,  NXP Semiconductors,  managed Lakshman indirectly at Samsung
Electronics

"Lakshman was one of the founding members of NFC team, also the youngest member of the
team. Largely because of his contributions in designing and developing NCI module, the team got
its first commercial success. A no-nonsense candidate, to the point and highly talented, Lakshman
will be an asset to any organization."
