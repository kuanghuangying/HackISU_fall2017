"I worked with Manoj when I was the Test Manager at Guru.com. At one point the entire
engineering team was either fired or quit and only Manoj and I were running the whole development
side of the product. I can say that, without a doubt, it would have been imposible without his help.
Manoj has an uncanny memory and recall of information not just stored in his databases, but
project history, various bits of detail about the evolution of the system, etc...Manoj has excellent
trouble shooting abilities and knows SQL Server inside and out. He also took over ownership of
the backend batch job servers and taught himself Cold Fusion during the time we worked together.
Manoj is a consumate professional and an invaluable asset to any team in need of his experience
