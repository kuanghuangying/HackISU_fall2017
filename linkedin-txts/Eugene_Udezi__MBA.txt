2 people have recommended Eugene

"Eugene was great to work with at Data Recognition Corporation. He was one of the developers I
could count on to complete his work correctly and on time. When it came to support, he was one
of the few developers who would do his homework on an issue and figure out the details before
escalating an issue."
—Brian White, Senior Developer,  Hodges-Mace, LLC,  managed Eugene indirectly at Data
Recognition Corporation

"Eugene was an IT Finance Business Analyst intern that I supervised at Valspar. He did a great
job helping me implement a Finance project during the summer that he was an intern there. He
caught on very quickly and was able to work without supervision a good portion of the time. He
has a friendly personality and was liked by everyone. I was hoping that there would have been a
full time position available at Valspar when he graduated but unfortunately there wasn't. I know he
would have been an asset."
—Leslie Scharafanow, Oracle EBS IS Business Analyst - Financials,  Graco,  managed Eugene
indirectly at Valspar
