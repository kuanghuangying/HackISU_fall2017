Software Engineer at Google

Summary
I am a machine learning researcher and engineer in the bay area. I currently work at Google display
 ads team, which aims to deliver relevant and contextual ads for internet users. Prior to Google, I
 worked at LinkedIn Feed Relevance team. I developed several features into LinkedIn feed ranking
 models that significantly improved the user engagement on LinkedIn feeds. ome parts of my old work
 are summarized in the blog "Making Your Feed More Relevant" : https://goo.gl/fvoSf5

I am broadly interested in data and information analysis including data mining, machine learning and
 information retrieval techniques. More specifically, I focus on user modeling and personalization in
 recommender systems, online advertising, multi-arm bandit algorithms, event mining that discovers
 and summarizes the hidden relations of the event data, streaming data, time series data and textual
 data.

Experience
Software Engineer at Google
September 2016  -  Present  (1 year 2 months)

Deliver contextual and relevant display ads for internet users.

Senior Software Engineer at LinkedIn
June 2014  -  September 2016  (2 years 4 months)

Develop large-scale data mining and machine learning techniques and optimize LinkedIn feed
 relevance models to provide personalized feed activity streams for each LinkedIn member. In
 particular, my projects include:
  1) Viewer-ActivityType affinity in the LinkedIn feed ranking model, leading to 3.6% CTR lift on
 LinkedIn mobile feeds and 2.5% CTR lift on LinkedIn desktop feeds.
  2) A/B Testing experiments for impression discounting with capping for LinkedIn desktop feeds,
 which provided 50%-60% repeatedness reduction without hurting CTR.
  3) Near-realtime item popularity in the LinkedIn feed ranking model, leading to +7.4% CTR on
 desktop and +5% CTR on mobile, +1.2% engaged feed session on desktop and +1.1% engaged
 feed session on mobile, and +1.5% revenue on sponsored updates from mobile platform.

Developed the "Browsemap" algorithm into the presentation recommendation in SlideShare,
 leading to +43% CTR on logged-in users and +30% CTR on logged-out users.

Applied Research Intern at LinkedIn
May 2013  -  August 2013  (4 months)

1) Investigated exploration/exploitation algorithms, such as UCB and Thompson Sampling, for Ads
recommendation and news ranking problems in LinkedIn website.
2) Implemented a Hadoop based replayer offline evaluation for exploration/exploitation algorithms.

Research Intern at IBM Watson Research Center
May 2012  -  August 2012  (4 months)

Investigated methodologies for discovering false negatives (missing alerts) of IBM Tivoli monitoring
system based on manual incident tickets. The aim is to optimize the configuration of IBM
Tivoli Monitoring System in individual and dynamic IT infrastructures.

Research Intern at IBM Watson Research Center
May 2011  -  August 2011  (4 months)

Proposed and designed a system component for IBM Tivoli Monitoring System for optimizing
 monitoring situations based on the ticket resolutions to reduce the number of non-actionable
 tickets.

Software Engineering Intern at Microsoft Research Asia
May 2007  -  December 2007  (8 months)

*  Developed a tool of CART (Classification and Regression Tree) algorithm on a large-scale
 parallel computing system, and applied it to analyze the Windows Vista boot time dataset to
 discover causal knowledge about the bottleneck of Windows startup. In charge of implementation
 using C++ and parallel version of algorithm design.
    * Developed a middle querying engine MDA ( Multidimensional Data Access) to handle
 multidimensional query on a BigTable system (a distributed data table), which was used by several
 research teams in DIT group of MSRA. In charge of the architecture design and implementation of
 kernel engine using C++.
