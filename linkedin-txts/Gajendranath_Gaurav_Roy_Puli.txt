Experience
Software Engineer at Apple
July 2017  -  Present  (4 months)

Software Engineering Intern at Critical Technologies
January 2017  -  May 2017  (5 months)

Maintaining C++ APIs that retrieve data from FPGA and forward it to web interfaces

Graduate Research Assistant at Syracuse University
June 2014  -  December 2016  (2 years 7 months)

Building hardware and algorithms for Cyber Physical Systems,Robotics swarm project. Distributed
 multi agent systems. Biologically inspired robots.

Graduate Teaching Assistant at Syracuse University
January 2014  -  May 2014  (5 months)

Was the robotics mentor for freshmen CS students(ECS 101 course). Built robots with IR proximity
 and communication sensors and designed a competition at the end of the semester. The class
 was divided into roughly 6 teams where they had to achieve certain tasks in which their scores
 and time's were recorded. Code was built into neat packages and the students just had to know
 basic knowledge of function calling and decision making statements(if, else, switch). It gave them a
 greater understanding of what exactly the uses of coding are in a way where they could see direct
 actions and consequences of their coding.
