3 people have recommended Ameya

"Ameya is an organized and goal oriented individual who tackles complex problems with his
quick and innovative solutions. This was evident during the development of the message-driven
framework for JMS in the JBoss project migration. He is ready to provide a helping hand wherever
necessary and makes sure all the deadlines are met while maintaining the highest standards. I
would recommend him to be a good fit for any team."
—Kashinath Kumbharakar, Senior Solutions Architect,  Red Hat,  worked directly with Ameya at
Tata Consultancy Services

"Ameya is a resourceful engineer who is unafraid of tackling large challenges. While I supervised
Ameya, I knew that I could count on him to iterate on a solution until it fully resolved the underlying
issue. When he joined us, he didn’t have professional experience using Python–but was able to
jump in and start contributing in his first week. Ultimately, Ameya is a mature software engineer who
you can rely on to accomplish the challenges that you set before him."
—Ryne McCall, Software Development Manager,  FlipKey by tripadvisor,  managed Ameya at
TripAdvisor

"Ameya exhibits the rare combination of being bright and having excellent software instincts with
strong interpersonal skills. I worked as his immediate supervisor for a year during the project
development and migration phases. His strengths in staying across issues, pro-actively providing
solutions and being adept at all aspects of communications make him a valuable contributor to any
situation or team. Keep it up..!!!"
