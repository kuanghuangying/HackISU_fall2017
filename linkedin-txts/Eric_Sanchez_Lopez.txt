1 person has recommended Eric

"Eric Sanches is a highly motivated engineer, with a wide knowledge of software and hardware
domains, I was lucky enough to work with him during his time in the Android Audio Integration
Team at the OTC (Open Technology Center) of Intel where I gained skills debugging the audio
hardware for our OEMS. Time later when he moved to the Android Sensors Team, he became the
person of reference to any doubt we had to problems related to sensors. Eric is a great asset to
Intel or any first class technology company."
—Marco Antonio Salgado Martínez, IoT (Internet Of Things) Engineer,  Intel Corporation,  worked
