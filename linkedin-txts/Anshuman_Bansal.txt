Principles of Functional Programming (15-150) Head Teaching Assistant at Carnegie Mellon
University
January 2016  -  May 2016  (5 months)

Managed a team of 18 teaching assistants to conduct a 240-person introductory functional
 programming course aimed at computer science freshmen.  

Staff responsibilities included creating homework assignments and recitation materials, leading
 recitations, assigning and grading homework assignments and exams, holding office hours, setting
 course policy, detecting academic integrity violations, responding to student questions online, and
 building and maintaining course infrastructure.

I conducted interviews for and selected TA candidates, and worked closely with the course's
 professor and each of the TAs through the semester to ensure that the course ran smoothly –
 conducting weekly staff meetings, delegating responsibilities for the above tasks, scheduling
 course events, gathering TA and student feedback, and setting TA and student expectations.
