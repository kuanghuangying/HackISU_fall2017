Summary
I am a highly motivated, detail-oriented, capable and dependable computer engineer. I take on new
 challenges enthusiastically and am a fast learner. I enjoy working on technically challenging projects
 that have a large impact. I'm interested in user-facing application development and backend work.

I currently work at TripAdvisor full-time on the Search and Navigation team as a software engineer. I
 first worked primarily on the mobile web platform, but nowadays I focus on building backend services
 for the Search team. In my spare time, I volunteer for the Girls Who Code organization and teach
 young girls how to code.

"I've worked with Kimberly for two years at TripAdvisor, during which time she's had a large impact
on the travel site's search product. At ease working both in frontend and backend service code,
she's always eagerly looking towards her next challenging project to build. She's shown care
for the bigger picture, managing the schedule coordination of large new features across several
collaborating teams. Kim's also left her mark on the company by volunteering to run our Sonar
static code analysis pipeline and tirelessly evangelizing adoption throughout the engineering
division. In parallel, she's been instrumental in building TripAdvisor's strong brand on-campus at the
University of Toronto by running student outreach sessions and resume coaching."
