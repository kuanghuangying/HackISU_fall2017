3 people have recommended Ryan

"Ryan has been performing entry level test engineering work for me as an intern since October
2009. His technical strengths are in networking, switching, automation and programming and his
soft skills are drive, initiative, written communication and innovation. An example of his combination
of talents was demonstrated when he developed and performed training in an innovative system
which saves test engineers on his team lots of time configuring switches in our test beds. If/when
we get an opening I plan on hiring him if someone else hasn't beat me to it. Right now we are not
hiring."
—Bill Thomson, Technical Leader, Cisco Security Development Lifecycle,  Cisco Systems, 
managed Ryan at Cisco Systems

"Ryan is passionate about software development and that passion positively affects those around
him on a daily basis. I personally witnessed Ryan reverse-engineer a poorly documented, barely
understood product (about 90,000 lines of code). He created the documentation and knowledge
base necessary to turn the project around. In so doing, he also found errors in the code and applied
an outside-the-box approach to fixing them, greatly simplifying the code. Ryan would be a valuable
asset to any company, and I would love to work with him again."
—Elizabeth Stelley, IT QA Manager,  Mr. Cooper,  worked with Ryan at ARGO Data Resource
Corporation

"I worked with Ryan on a few projects at Cisco since 2009. He made a significant contribution to our
group's success. He is unafraid to try new, non-traditional solutions in order to get work done, and
he is an out-of-the-box thinker who constantly seeks to improve. He will be a great asset for any
organization."
—Phuong Nguyen, Senior Network Engineer,  OVH US,  managed Ryan indirectly at Cisco
Systems
