Especially named entity\n recognition using both supervised machine learning and clustering algorithms.\n\nMachine learning: link prediction in complex networks, document classification and sequencing data\n tagging. Automatic hypothesis generation by mining large-scaled biomedical literature and existing\n protein-protein interaction network structures.\n\nGraph analysis: complex network analysis, including scientific collaboration networks, citation\n networks and protein-protein interaction networks.  Develop algorithms for link prediction and object\n ranking based on the topology and semantic characteristics.\n\nInformation retrieval : document indexing and search quality improvement, query construction.\n\nSpecialties: machine learning, social network analysis, graph analysis, NLP, information retrieval\n\n"}],"education_and_training":[{"Education":"\nUniversity of Wisconsin-Milwaukee\nPhD, Computer Science, 2008 - 2014\n"}],"basics":{"gender":"male","name":{"firstName":"Shane","surname":"Ong"},"title":"Engineer","url":["http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">"]},"accomplishments":[{"Research":" Assistant at University of Wisconsin Milwaukee\nSeptember 2008  -  June 2011  (2 years 10 months)\n\nI've been working on citation analysis and clinical document classification. 1) Citation recognition.\n Developed a citation parser to extract citation information from PDF article. The full citation in the\n end of the article is mapped to the occurrence in the text. The fields, such as author and title,  of\n the citation are also identified. 2) Citation graph analysis. Rank the author authorization and article\n impact in the same network using the mutual reinforcement relations of the author and the article.\n 3)  Clinical evidence classifier. Build a collection of classifiers to identify clinical related articles and\n classify them into clinical-interested categories such as diagnosis and treatment.\n\nSoftware Engineer at Quality Easy Inc. (Beijing, China)\nJuly 2007  -  July 2008  (1 year 1 month)\n\n�Worked on the project of EosTest. The product is an automatic Web service testing tool for\n Primeton (http:\/\/www.primeton.com\/en\/) product EosStudio.
