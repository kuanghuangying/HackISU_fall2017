I'm fascinated with every level\n there is to web development from inception to design to development and to release. My tools of\n the trade are HTML5, CSS3 (SCSS), JavaScript, jQuery, Git, Wordpress and soon to be Django,\n AngularJS, and MySQL. Always looking and implementing latest trends but keeping a close eye on\n graceful degradation and cross-browser\/device experiences.
