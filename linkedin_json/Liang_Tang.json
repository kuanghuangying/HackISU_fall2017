I currently work at Google display\n ads team, which aims to deliver relevant and contextual ads for internet users. Prior to Google, I\n worked at LinkedIn Feed Relevance team. I developed several features into LinkedIn feed ranking\n models that significantly improved the user engagement on LinkedIn feeds. ome parts of my old work\n are summarized in the blog \"Making Your Feed More Relevant\" : https:\/\/goo.gl\/fvoSf5\n\nI am broadly interested in data and information analysis including data mining, machine learning and\n information retrieval techniques. More specifically, I focus on user modeling and personalization in\n recommender systems, online advertising, multi-arm bandit algorithms, event mining that discovers\n and summarizes the hidden relations of the event data, streaming data, time series data and textual\n data.\n\n"}],"education_and_training":[{"Education":"\nFlorida International University\nPh.D, Computer Science, 2009 - 2014\nSichuan University\nMaster, Computer Science, 2006 - 2009\n"}],"basics":{"gender":"male","name":{"firstName":"Liang","surname":"Tang"},"title":"Software Engineer","url":["http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">"]},"accomplishments":[{"Research":" Intern at "},{"Research":" Intern at "}],"extracurricular":[{"Activities":" and Societies:  Studying the areas of data mining and databases.\nHigh School Affiliated to Southwest University of China\nHigh School, "}],"work_experience":[{"date_start":"September 2016","jobtitle":"Software Engineer","text":"  -  Present  (1 year 2 months)\n\nDeliver contextual and relevant display ads for internet users.\n\n"},{"date_start":"June 2014","jobtitle":"Senior Software Engineer","date_end":"September 2016","text":"  (2 years 4 months)\n\nDevelop large-scale data mining and machine learning techniques and optimize LinkedIn feed\n relevance models to provide personalized feed activity streams for each LinkedIn member.
