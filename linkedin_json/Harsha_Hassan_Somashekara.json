His Strengths are: * Very Good interpersonal skill. *\nSolution Oriented, * Analyticial Thinking\/Problem Solving\"\n\u2014Niteesh Rai, Product Owner,  SAP,  managed Harsha at SAP\n\n\"Harsha and I worked in the same software group when we were both interns at Cengage Learning.\nHe is very proactive, self-driven in terms of learning new technologies both inside and outside of\nthe work. Harsha is also very easy going, humble, and patient. He is always willing to answer any\nquestions you have. \"\n\u2014Shawn Feng, Software QA Engineer,  Abbott,  worked directly with Harsha at Cengage Learning\n\n\"Harsha was amazing as a mentor to me during my internship at Amazon. He helped me raise\nmy bar of software development, be it efficient code-structure, or testing, or even documentation.\nHe showed me that there's almost always a simpler way of doing things, so one should be on the\nlookout for such enhancements. He's an excellent SDE himself, and I was happy to have him as my\nmentor !\"\n\u2014Nikhil Kulkarni, Graduate Teaching Assistant,  University of California San Diego,  reported to\nHarsha at Amazon\n\n\"Harsha and I had a number of very interesting talks. During one I mentioned MongoDB, a NOSQL\ndatabase. I compared MongoDB to MySQL but was unclear on some points; Harsha, over the next\nseveral days, took it upon himself to dive into Mongo and to fill me in on his learning as he went. I\nthink I learned as much as Harsha did and I was thoroughly impressed with Harsha's intense desire\nto both learn and share in the process. Harsha knows when to dive in and when to ask questions,\nand will be a valuable asset wherever he lands.\"\n\u2014Bob Allen, Agile Coach,  Ford Motor Company via TEKSystems,  managed Harsha indirectly at\nCengage Learning\n\n�\"Harsha worked on my Amazon Marketing Portal team as an SDE. He is a smart, talented, and\nresourceful person, and was instrumental in the success of the team and the product. He is fun to\nwork with and a great \"team player\". I'd be happy to work with him again!\"\n\u2014David Starck, Manager, Transportation Technology, SSP,  Amazon,  managed Harsha at\nAmazon\n\n\"I have had the privilege of working with Harsha at Amazon Marketing Portal team during the past\n7 months, and I can truly say that he has been one of the most, if not the most, influential members\nof the team. Not only he was always willing to pick up new challenges, but also tried to focus on\nfollowing the best practices and standards. Harsha also has been a great mentor. He listened to my\nconcerns, and advised me on how I can improve on my weakness. I cannot speak highly enough\nabout Harsha.
