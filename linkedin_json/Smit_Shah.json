I have dealt with OLTP systems at the storage layer,\n but am also keenly interested in warehousing, realtime stream based computation, and analytics\n challenges. \n\nAt Terminal.com, I am gaining experience building systems from scratch, some of the recent projects\n I am working on are: building a high throughput, scalable, available usage event stream for metering,\n pricing and billing systems, a low latency data serving layer for customer usage and bills, and a\n streaming machine image layer for fast cluster spinup. \n\nI am always interested in knowing about and exploring new challenges.
