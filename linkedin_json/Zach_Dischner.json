{"summary":[{"Summary":"\nEndlessly curious, thrilled by sensible systems and clean implementation, daunted only by\n stagnation. \n\nI love the fast paced and dynamic world of software development, and have been actively working\n to incorporate it's aspects into Aerospace Engineering. The industry constantly achieves the\n improbable, but often with out-of-date tools and methodologies. I would love to see a revolution\n industry-wide that mirrors modern companies like SpaceX. \n\nI'm an Aerospace engineer by education, but work heavily in electronics and software. I've built small\n web sites, database-driven processing suites, flight software for high altitude balloon observatories,\n and countless other projects. I get a kick out of solid, sensible workflows and bringing ideas from\n concept to production. \n\nProgramming\/development - C\/C++, Python, R, MATLAB, Bash, IDL, Ruby on Rails, HTML, Ansys\n FEM, Linux, and some experience with Perl. \n\nExample applications - My favorite: built a closed loop motion stabilization with fine-steering mirror\/\northogonal transfer CCD. Achieved state-of-the-art fine pointing from a high-altitutde-balloon gondola.\n Involved high speed image acquisition and analysis from Andor Zyla, Princeton Instruments ProEM\n+ scientific cameras. OS level interfaces with stepper motors, digital and analog sensing, DAC\/ADC\n boards, local networks. Database driven processing suites in MATLAB, Python, and IDL. \n\nElectronics - Custom PCBs, Analog and Digital design\/interfaces, cabling, and debugging\n methodology. Most notably, I was the main designer of a custom CMOS imaging system, with ground\n up design starting from just the sensor.\n\nCurrently working on: Writing Mission Operations Center and planning software for the CYGNSS\n constellation, sequencer and tool developer for the New Horizons mission, BOPPS UVVis instrument\n lead software engineer, contribute to open source software projects.\n\nCurrent learning goals involve data science and machine learning, what an awesome new field!\n\n�Experience\nSoftware "}],"education_and_training":[{"Education":"\nUdacity\nNanodegree, Data Science, 2017 - 2017\nCoursera\nIntroduction to Machine Learning, 2016 - 2016\nUniversity of Colorado\nMasters\/Bachelors, Aerospace  Engineering; Electrical  Engineering, 2008 - 2013\nBS\nBS, Aerospace Engineering, 2008 - 2012\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder\nBS, Aerospace, 2008 - 2012\n"}],"basics":{"gender":"male","name":{"firstName":"Zach","surname":"Dischner"},"title":"Development Engineer","url":["http:\/\/www.w3.org\/1999\/xhtml\">"]},"extracurricular":[{"Activities":" and Societies:  Hiking Club, Alpine Club, Backcountry club, Photography club, Phi Sigma Pi\n honors fraternity, Boulder Freeride.\n\n�Zach Dischner\nGreater Denver Area\nSoftware "}],"work_experience":[{"date_start":"10\/21\/2017","jobtitle":"Development Engineer","organization":"Amazon","text":"\u2014View by Shane Ong\n\n�<\/p>\n<\/body><\/html"},{"date_start":"July 2017","jobtitle":"Development Engineer","text":"  -  Present  (4 months)\n\nElectronics and "},{"date_start":"March 2013","jobtitle":"Software Engineer","date_end":"January 2017","text":"  (3 years 11 months)\n\nI am a do-it-all software and electronics engineer for the Southwest Research Institute. Among\n my bigger roles was as a lead instrument software engineer on the BRRISON\/BOPPS mission.\n I wrote balloon flight software and integrated electronics\/CDH hardware for its science missions.\n Programming in C++, Python, Matlab, and SQL. I have experience creating custom interfaces\n between computer hardware and scientific cameras, motors, analog and digital sensing and control\n interfaces, and data downlinking and uplinking perhiperals. \n\nCurrently, my big project is creating a constellation mission planning system with Python, STK,\n Scheduler, and ITOS for the CYGNSS mission. In creating a Mission Operations Center (MOC)\n for the constellation of spacecraft, I have been the go-to software patcher and integrator, working\n every aspect of the MOC from project CM\/Documentation, JIRA Agile PM tool integration, CCSDS\n packet processing and L0 data pipelines, and MOC digital infrastructure management. \n\nIn addition, I served as a sequencer for the New Horizons Pluto flyby, and help create software\n tools to support the mission. \n\nI have lead the installation, IT management, and incorporation of Owncloud, Gitlab, Atlassian\n Jira, Stash, and Confluence cloud services at the Institute. In addition, I am leading an effort\n to incorporate Agile project management methodologies and tools into day-to-day engineering\n practice.  \n\nPhotographer at Zach Dischner Photography\nAugust 2010  -  January 2016  (5 years 6 months)\n\nHigh resolution nature and landscape photos, portraits, and commercial shoots.\n\n"},{"Freelance":" Photographer at Airbnb\nApril 2011  -  March 2015  (4 years)\n\nTravel to sites and document locations for rent.
