Ankit is enthusiastic, persistent and\nhas excellent programming skills. He understands the nuances of working with a large codebase\nand writing modular extensible code. He has exposure to good design practices, writes unit tests for\nhis code and is comfortable building something which can be extended upon later. At the start of his\ninternship, Ankit was provided with an open-ended problem. He started off independently, doing his\nresearch by reading up on research papers, talking with senior people in the company to come up\nwith initial algorithms which he later refined over the period of 2 months. He was able to completely\ndemonstrate the solution, checkin all his code and unit tests and also provide documentation on his\nwork during this short period. I wish him best of luck for all his future endeavors.\"\n\u2014Deepank Gupta, "},{"date_start":"10\/21\/2017","jobtitle":"Engineering Manager","organization":"Google","text":"\u2014View by Shane Ong\n\n�<\/p>\n<\/body><\/html"}]}
