Working with him has\nbeen an honor and a pleasure. He is always prompt, precise and constructive, proposing very\ngood solutions to problems. He has always followed mentors\u2019 suggestions, but he also enriched\nsuch suggestions with his ideas. He has worked in a very independent way, in according with his\nmentors. He has collaborated with another GSoC student too, to merge their projects (since they\nwere related to the same open source project), showing good skills also in cooperative working\nwith other people. Moreover, the code he developed was very well designed and written. During\nthe whole project, he has shown different and high skills (in learning new issues and technologies,\ncoding, designing interfaces, testing phases, communicating, etc). He is very qualified and I\u2019ll be\nglad to work with him again.\"\n\u2014Silvia Mirri, Assistant professor,  Università di Bologna,  managed Anirudh at Google\n\n\"Anirudh is a hard working software developer that worked with us last summer as an intern at\nFreescale Semiconductor. We understand embedded developers but did not have experience with\nSaaS and Cloud solutions. Anirudh helped us develop a prototype of cloud services that included\nestablishing cloud servers, leveraging a scalable Linux server framework and built a PC based\nplugin to our tools to connect to the cloud for getting software updates. The server side required\nanalytics work, database integration, and included a REST API implementation. Anirudh also taught\nhimself some embedded programming and worked in collaboration with both a local and remote\nteam in Europe.
