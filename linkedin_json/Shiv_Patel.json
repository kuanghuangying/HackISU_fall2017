He's exceedingly quick,\nintellectually curious, confident, personable, and has all the tireless motivation and unflagging\nreliability that you're fortunate to find in a seasoned co-worker, let alone a college student.\nEspecially in a fairly unstructured environment like the four-person NYC office of Two Toasters,\nShiv displayed tremendous discipline and focus in creating his own workflows and constantly\nlooking for opportunities to lend a hand or take the lead - whatever necessary to push the ball\nforward. Above-and-beyond is a matter of course with Shiv - I can't recommend him highly enough.\n\"\n\u2014Sean Schultz, Strategic Initiatives,  InVisionApp Inc,  worked directly with Shiv at Two Toasters\n(Acquired by Ticketmaster)\n\n\"I managed Shiv over the summer of 2014. We interviewed a bunch of candidates before choosing\nShiv and I'm delighted we chose him. Shiv is incredibly thoughtful, calm, and nice to be around. He\nis emotionally intelligent, easy to talk to, and was quickly an equal member of the team. He worked\nhard when we needed him to and provided great insights. He also has a curiosity about technology\nand trends and taught me a lot. I would strongly endorse Shiv. It was a pleasure working alongside\nhim.\"\n\u2014Simon B.

Over the last decade, there has been an explosion\n of content on the web, and consumers are overwhelmed with a seemingly infinite supply of\n content to watch, listen to, and read. The top consumer technology companies (Facebook, Twitter,\n Snapchat, etc.) have responded by hiring curators. This is the strategy that Yahoo attempted to\n employ, but was rendered obsolete by the large and growing volume of available content. \n\n�We believe the future of discovery is better placed in the hands of the people and not those of a\n select few professionals.\n\nH'university Teaching Assistant at Harry's\nAugust 2014  -  December 2014  (5 months)\n\nH\u2019university is a part of Harry\u2019s social mission to teach real-world skills to students through a series\n of webinars and challenges.\n\nSummer Business Development Associate at Two Toasters (Acquired by Ticketmaster)\nMay 2014  -  August 2014  (4 months)\n\nTwo Toasters specializes in the design and development of native iOS and Android applications.\n Notable past clients include Airbnb, JackThreads, and Birchbox.\n\nBrand "},{"date_start":"August 2013","jobtitle":"Representative","date_end":"May 2014","text":"  (10 months)\n\n\u2022 Planned and executed individual and collaborative on-campus events to promote brand visibility.\n\u2022 Compiled 1350 surveys to gauge impressions of Microsoft before and after conducting\n personalized demonstrations of its products and services.\n\n"},{"Experience":"\nSoftware "},{"date_start":"August 2016","jobtitle":"Development Engineer","text":"  -  Present  (1 year 3 months)\n2nd Engineer on the AWS Migration Hub\n\nProduct Manager (Software Engineering and Design) at University of Pennsylvania\nSeptember 2015  -  May 2016  (9 months)\n\nCIS573 is a graduate level software engineering course focused on agile development principles\n and optimal code design patterns.\n\nSenior Information Technology "}]}
