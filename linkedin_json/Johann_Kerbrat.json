He is\nrigorously versed in all layers of the stack (I particularly appreciated his SQL expertise) and knows\nhow to choose the best tools to craft a well-scaled solution. In addition, Johann has an unparalleled\nwork ethic and spirit. He is extremely reliable and very reactive. He is firm and empathetic with the\npeople he manages. He can foster a positive work culture while still holding his team to ambitious\nand tough goals. I worked with Johann at StreamNation. When he joined, he unexpectedly inherited\nleadership of the front-end products. The company pivoted and Johann had to re-engineer a new\nproduct from the ground up. He worked tirelessly and managed to harness the energy of his team\nto ship an impressive product in very good time.\"\n\u2014Emmanuel Turlay, Machine Learning Engineer,  Instacart,  worked directly with Johann at\n"},{"Milestone Project":" Inc.\n\n\"Johann is the type of engineer that is a constant delight to work with. He is extremely strong\ntechnically on multiple platforms, and is also a great learner and can pick up new languages,\ntechnologies and concepts very quickly. He constantly seeks out work that is the most important,\neven when this means it isn\u2019t the most highly visible or flashiest. When you tie this technical ability\nwith his product sense, you find an engineer that is pushing the technology and the product forward\nin really meaningful ways. Johann is also an exceptional mentor, mixing various techniques to\nhelp the entire engineering team get better. These include strong, helpful code reviews, leading by\nexample through important, complex, and well tested refactorings, pair programming and tech talks.\nIn summary, Johann is extremely technical, understands user\u2019s needs well enough to find the most\nimpactful work, humble about his abilities, and an incredible teacher. I look forward to many more\nyears of working with Johann.\"\n\u2014Gabe Westmaas, Engineering Manager,  Airbnb,  managed Johann at Tilt.com\n\n\"I feel very lucky to have had the opportunity to work with Johann. Along with his expertise at all\nlevels of the stack and his exceptional software capabilities, Johann is a great team leader and\npushes the team forward, even when things are tough, to ship a high quality product quickly. He\nhad to manage a team of junior developers alone, while re-engineering a new product from the\n\n�ground up on the front-end web and delivered impressive results. We worked together with the\nproduct team on the global engineering and the communication between the front-end product and\nthe API. It was both challenging and productive. I'd be glad to work with him again, whenever he\nwants!\"\n\u2014David Bonnet, iOS Software Engineer, Founder,  Harpp,  worked with Johann at Milestone\n"},{"Project":" Inc.\n\n\"I've worked with Johann for over a year both across teams, and as his manager, and I can say that\nin both cases it has been an absolute pleasure. Johann brings amazing insights both technically\nand at the product level that consistently push the envelope and improve the product (and team)\non all fronts. He's a passionate, driven contributor who will constantly stretch himself and the\nteam towards the best outcomes he can. I'm consistently impressed by his technical prowess and\ndecision-making, and the speed at which he ramps up on new things.

Johann can not only be counted on to deliver\non-time, but he is committed to delivering a quality app with a focus on architectural correctness.\nHe stays informed of the latest front-end toolkits and knows when to use open source correctly.\nEven rarer is his ability to lead the team or work independently. Aside from hands-on programming\nexpertise in a variety of areas, he is also a great mentor to those less experienced. He also has a\ngreat sense of design and products UI.

The impact\nhe made in his first 30 days took our product (Tilt's enterprise offering, Tilt Pro) and our team\nmorale to levels beyond what I've ever witnessed with a new engineer joining a product I was\nPM'ing. His work touched every part of our stack, including a significant React re-write, a brand\nnew, CSS animation-heavy, landing page, and a dynamic onboarding tool for users that led to a\n200%+ increase in revenue-generating conversions over a two month period.
