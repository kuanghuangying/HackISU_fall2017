I have solid knowledge of software engineering, artificial intelligence,\n networking and machine learning. In my projects relate to data analysis in the field of AI, I found it  is\n interesting to design a system and let it help to achieve the goal base on the knowledge provided by\n the data set provided. During the education I spent in the university I also take some course relate to\n statistics in order to strengthen my background in the field. Also in some projects relate to software\n engineering which help me review the knowledge I got during undergraduate and also help me to get\n   experience such as requirement analysis, system design and software design.\n\n Currently I'm working at SkyGlue as a Full Stack Software Engineer, I Implement and test a data\n processing pipeline system to transform data in the proper format, the system is built by python.
