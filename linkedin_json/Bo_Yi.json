During my time at the NUS HCI Lab, i had the pleasure to\nadvise and work with Yi Bo, who was then a graduate student. I have come to learn Yi Bo as an\noutstanding engineer and computer scientist. He takes on a task, carries out the work, and comes\nback with the results expected -- often more -- at time. He delivers first-class results and will be a\ngreat contribution to any R&amp;D in the area of computer science, computer consulting, development,\nand\/or innovation.
